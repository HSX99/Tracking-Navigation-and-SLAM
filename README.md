The exercises are all part of a typical application theme, namely tracking, navigation and SLAM:
• Bayesian estimation applied to beacon based measurement systems
• Kinematic and dynamic models for tracking
• Tracking based on discrete Kalman filtering for linear-Gaussian systems
• Tracking with extended Kalman filtering in nonlinear systems
• Tracking with particle filtering in nonlinear systems
• Slam
As such the exercises cover the following theoretical subjects:
1. Fundamentals of parameter estimation; static and scalar case
2. Unbiased linear minimum mean square estimation; static and scalar case
3. Unbiased linear minimum mean square estimation; static and vectorial case
4. Propagation of uncertainty in Gaussian-linear systems; prediction
5. Discrete Kalman filtering
6. Extended Kalman filtering
7. Particle filtering
8. SLAM

Certain projects are still on progress.
