We reconsider the ultrasonic depth gauge discussed in exercise 1. Data sets that are obtained 
from the probabilistic model. Each data set contains 200 realizations. The realizations are a-select and independent.


The goal of this exercise is:

• To design a linMMSE estimator and an unbiased linMMSE estimator using the first data set.

• To evaluate these estimators with respect to bias and variance using the second data set.
