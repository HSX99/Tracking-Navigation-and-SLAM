We consider the navigation problem that is introduced in the first lecture. The parameter vector to estimate is 
the position x=[x y]' of a ship. The prior knowledge, obtained via dead reckoning, is captured as a (prior) expectation 
μx and a covariance matrix Cx. The latter expresses the (prior) uncertainty that we have about the position.
In order to increase the accuracy, the navigator of the ship takes a bearing. That is, he measures the
direction 0ϕ of the line of sight between the ship and a beacon (lighthouse) using a compass.
