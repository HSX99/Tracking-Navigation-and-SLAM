This exercise involve discrete kalman filtering in radar tracking.

We consider the dynamic process, a kinematic model that is used for tracking.
The state vector consists of the 2-D position Î¾(i), the velocity v(i), and the acceleration a(i) of a vehicle. 
The acceleration is modelled as a stable, first order AR process.
