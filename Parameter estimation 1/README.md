Exercise 1: Fundamentals of parameter estimation - part I
MAP estimation, MMSE estimation; MMAE estimation; ML estimation
In this exercise, we consider an ultrasonic depth gauge which is used to measure the depth of the water below a ship.
During the measurement an ultrasonic tone burst is transmitted downwards from the underside of the boat. 
The waveform reflects at the bottom of the sea. The echo is picked up by a receiver mounted under the boat. 


The measurement may be disturbed by the following phenomena:
• Secondary echoes
The echo may reflect at the bottom of the boat causing a second echo that arrives at t=4x/c. 
The second echo may cause a third echo, and so on. In contrast with the second echo, the third echo and any succeeding 
echoes are weak and negligible. However, sometimes, the second echo overrules the first echo.
In that case the ToF becomes ToF=4x/c.
• Electronic noise.

The conditional probability was calculated, various estimations were performed and compared. Cost function was then used to 
evaluate the conditional risk.
